# Overview

Welcome to the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) Government Data Archiving team.

We are:
* Building online tools, helping events, and creating research networks to proactively preserve, archive and track public environmental data and ensure its continued availability
* Indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports
* Working with protocols for resilient, sustainable, distributed data storage networks

This repository is an overview for people who are getting involved in the project.

Our GitHub organization, chat, and in-person events have a [Code of Conduct](/CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

We have a technical [**Roadmap**](/ROADMAP.md) organized in planning cycles and we use a [Kanban Board](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/projects/2) to work toward those milestones. In addition, each project covers specific tasks, issues, and milestones in individual repositories.

## Working Openly

EDGI operates under horizontal-organizing principles. We have developed guidelines for open project development in line with these principles, which you can find in this repo:

- [Volunteer Code of Conduct](/CONDUCT.md)
- [Contributing Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Community Call, Onboarding, and Project Guidelines](/guidelines)
