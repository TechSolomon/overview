# Overview

Welcome to the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) Government Data Archiving team.

We are:
* Building online tools, helping events, and creating research networks to proactively preserve, archive and track public environmental data and ensure its continued availability
* Indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports
* Working with protocols for resilient, sustainable, distributed data storage networks

This repository is an overview for people who are getting involved in the project.

Our GitHub organization, chat, and in-person events have a [Code of Conduct](/CONDUCT.md) and [Contributor Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

In addition, each project covers specific tasks, issues, and milestones in individual repositories.
